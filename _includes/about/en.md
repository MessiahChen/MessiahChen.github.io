> Fiat lux 

Hi, I'm Mingjie(Michael) Chen, an undergraduate student major in Software Engineering at Software College, [Northeastern 
University(CN)](http://www.neu.edu.cn/). I studied at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) for one semester in 2019.

I have spent part of my life in Ningbo, Shenyang, Raleigh(NC) and San Fransisco.

I have visited many cities in the world. I can speak Mandarin, English, Japanes(N3) and a little bit Korean and Cantonese.

##### [My PL Spectrum (WIP 🚧)](https://huangxuan.me/2020/05/05/pl-chart/)

I made a chart to visualize my experiences and interests on some of the programming languages.   I know, I know this could be very contraversial. But it's a quite self-entertaining side project to do right? So have fun and don't take it too serious!
